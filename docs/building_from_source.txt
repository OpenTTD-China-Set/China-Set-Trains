2 Building from source
----------------------

Usually there's not much which needs to be changed when you obtain the
source. Your friends will usually be
    make
	make install
Both will build the grf from source, the latter will also try to copy
the grf into your grf folder so that it is available for testing and
use straight away.


2.1 Obtaining the source
------------------------

The source code can be obtained from the #openttdcoop DevZone
via source browser:
    http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/finnishtrainset/repository
or via mercurial checkout:
    hg clone http://hg.openttdcoop.org/finnishtrainset
or via a source bundle download (releases and nightlies only):
    http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/finnishtrainset/


2.2 Dependencies
----------------

Requirements for running the Makefile successfully:
	NML
	gcc
	md5sum (or md5 on Mac)
	make
    mercurial (recommended)
    python (recommended)

If you want to bundle the grf, you'll need additionally
	tar
	zip
	bzip2
	unix2dos (optional)

Windows only:
On Windows systems this means that you'll need to install MinGW and MSys
in order to obtain a posix compatible environment. Then the makefile can
be called the very same way as it is on linux and mac systems.
MinGW/MSys contain the above mentioned programmes (except NML of course) 
and can be obtained from http://www.mingw.org/ That site also features 
an excellent walk-through on how to install it.0

If you use for OpenTTD data folder a non-default path or Windows with a
non-English localization make sure to copy Makefile.local.sample to
Makefile.local and edit the line with
	INSTALLDIR =
accordingly so that it shows the full path to your OpenTTD data
directory.


2.3 Makefile targets
--------------------

A brief overview over all Makefile targets is given here:

all:
	This is the default target, if also no parameter is given to
	make. It will simply build the grf file, if it needs building

depend:
	Re-run the dependency check. Usually not manually needed.

docs:
	Build the documentation files

bundle:
	This target will create a directory called "<name>-nightly" and
	copy the grf file there and the documentation files, readme.txt,
	changelog.txt and license.txt

bundle_zip
	This will zip the bundle directory into one zip for distribution

bundle_tar
	This will tar the bundle directory into a tar archive for
	distribution or upload to bananas

bundle_src
	Creates a source bundle

install:
	This will create a tar archive (like bundle_tar) and copy it
	into the INSTALLDIR as specified in Makefile.local (or the
	default dir, if that isn't defined). Don't rely on a good
	detection of the default installation directory. It's
	especially bound to fail on windows machines.

distclean:
	This phony target cleans everything from a source bundle which
	wasn't shipped.

clean:
	This phony target will delete all files which this Makefile will
	create

mrproper:
	This phony target will delete also all directories created by
	different Makefile targets

remake:
	It's a shortcut for first cleaning the dir and then making the
	grf anew.

addcheck:
	Check whether there are some files required but not part of the
	repository.

check:
	Check the md5sum of the built newgrf against the supplied md5sum
	(Intended to be used when building from tar balls)


2.4 Speed issues
----------------

A note concerning the speed of the makefile:
It seems that the required tools using MinGW and / or msys are thoroughly
slow on Windows. A few example run times for OpenGFX, same processor type
(both core 2 duo, 2.26GHz for the windows machine, 2.0 GHz for the OSX
machine). Note that the values given are the 'real' time. Even though
this varies more and is dependent on the processor load, that's what you
have to wait for; the 'user' times are quite low on the Windows machine
(~16s), but that by no means reflects the build time. Times are from
OpenGFX r539 with makefile r199.
