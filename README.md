## 1. General Information

China Set: Trains is the train sector of the China set of OpenTTD.
China Set: Trains is licensed under GPL v2.

Everything in this set is Mainland China rolling stock, in addition of
several wagon types from international/interregional connections.

Locomotives and multiple units featuring refitting are for liveries.

The default setting should be build year livery, which means that
locomotive, multiple unit or coach will remain on the livery scheme as
built. Another option is to manually choose a livery from liveries
already introduced.

Wagon refitting behaves as in normal OpenTTD, there is cargo-specific
graphics on major part of wagons.

List of available parameters:

## 2. Building

The source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenTTD-China-Set/China-Set-Trains). These tools are required to build the GRF:

- nml
- make
- gcc
- gorender, or renderobject

You would need to render all models first, then you can build the GRF.

> [!NOTE]
> The first build will be slow since all models have to be rendered, which is a slow process.
> You can use `make -j n` to speed up the process by running multiple tasks at once where `n` is the task limit.

Using Linux or WSL:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# you'll have to install gorender from https://github.com/mattkimber/gorender
# here we use apt for demo

# dependencies
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install make
pip3 install nml
# we would also need gcc, but that should be already included in most distros

# compiling
make
```

Using Windows (Scoop is advised here, but non-scoop compilations are also possible):

```powershell
# we suggest you to use scoop; you can get scoop @ https://scoop.sh

# dependencies
scoop bucket add main
scoop bucket add openttd https://github.com/WenSimEHRP/OpenTTD-Bucket
scoop install python
scoop install make
scoop install openttd/nml
scoop install openttd/gorender
# we would need the gcc compiler in from mingw
scoop install mingw

# compiling
make
```
